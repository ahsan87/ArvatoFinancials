# ArvatoFinancials
Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree Capstone Project

This consists of the following two project:

1. Arvato customer segmentation and comaprison with general population

    We used various data cleanup techniques, PCA to reduce dimensionality and KNN to finally do segmentation.

2. Make a model to preduct whether someone will be a good candidate for targeted campaign for the bank

    We used the previously done data cleanup techniques, PCA to reduce dimensionality and finally different machine learning algorithm so that we can get an optimal model.
